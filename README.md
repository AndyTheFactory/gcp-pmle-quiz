# Quiz Learner — Streamlit App

Run the app locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py

Data files:
- `data/quizzes.jsonl`: quiz items (one JSON object per line) with fields: `question` (str), `options` (list[str]), `answer` (int index), `explanation` (str).
- `data/progress.json`: autogenerated to store your progress (which questions were answered correct/wrong).

Usage:

- Press `Start` to begin asking questions selected randomly from unanswered and previously-wrong questions.
- After submitting an answer, feedback and the explanation are shown and progress is saved.
- Press `Reset progress` to clear your progress.
