# Quiz Learner — Streamlit App

## Description

This is a Streamlit application designed to help users prepare for the Google Cloud Professional Machine Learning Engineer (PMLE) certification exam. The app provides a quiz interface and around 850 questions.

By going though all these questions, users can reinforce their understanding of key concepts and topics covered in the PMLE exam. Wrong answers are tracked to help users focus on areas where they need improvement. You can retry wrong answers until you master them.

If you want to use Notebook LM to help you prepping for the Certification exam, you can export a markdown file with all the questions you got wrong, and use it as a source for Notebook LM. Prompt then Notebook LM to create quizzes and flashcards based on these questions. You can use a prompt like this:

```

Create a quiz that relies on questions i answered incorrectly. Use those questions and answers as templates to create more quizz questions.
Base your questions also on the best practice documents provided
```
